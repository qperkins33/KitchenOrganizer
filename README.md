Project Milestone 3 – Implementation
Due March 20, 2024 @ 6:00 PM

{Requirements}:


Code Implementation:

Review your submission for Project Milestone 2 and consider the class diagrams you drew. Are the
classes still relevant to your implementation? If you have decided to make any changes that’s okay.
Software design and implementation details change as project features are added.
Implement in Java the classes you drew in your class diagrams from Project Milestone 2 but update the
classes implementations and relationships as necessary. It is okay at this point to mock external systems.
In other words, if your application communicates with a database or a network server, the class that
interfaces with these components can return hard coded values.

At a minimum the code should implement at least the following:
- Four (4) class definitions of classes that can be instantiated with the “new” keyword.
- One (1) Interface.
- One (1) Abstract Class.


User Interface Implementation:

Implement the main screen of the user interface for your application. All values can be hardcoded at this
point. You may either hard code the values directly in the UI code, or you can create hard coded objects
that expose the values to the UI layer. The UI does not need to have any functionality. It does not need
to validate user input. It does not need to respond to clicks. Use the wireframe you submitted in Project
Milestone 2 but incorporate any changes you have decided to make.


Deliverables:
- A README.md or README.txt file that answers the following questions:
- How is the code structured? Where are the classes that satisfy the “Code Implementation” requirements?
- How does one run the application?
- Zip your project folder which should contain all of your code, including the gradle build files and the README and submit the zip file to D2L.

Further considerations:
- Working code is required. The project should compile and run without modification. If the code requires modification to compile or crashes when running, there is a 25% penalty. For example, if after grading you receive 90/100 for the implementation, but the project crashes or does not compile, your final grade will be (90 * 0.75) / 100 = 68/100.
- Before submitting, copy the zip file to another directory and then extract it. Follow the instructions in your README. Ensure that the project compiles and runs.
